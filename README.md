An AI-based scouting system that helps coaches and scouts identify talented footballers by analyzing and comparing their athletic metrics and movement techniques with those of professional players. The system uses video footage of professionals performing key actions like free kicks, penalties, and shooting as benchmarks, combined with athletic data stored in a dataset. By analyzing an athlete's movements through pose estimation and evaluating physical attributes such as speed, VO₂ max, and acceleration, our AI provides a clear rating that covers every aspect needed to succeed in football. 

YOLOv8-Pose didn’t accurately detect the keypoints we needed, especially for specific football actions like run-ups, penalty, and free kicks.(we plan to integrate it once we get the help needed to fix the keypoints.)
